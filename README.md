Do note that this was the first thing I've done after that 2-week "break" I
took, so it's likely not as optimized as it could be if I had freshly read
through the course. But also I just didn't bother to go back and read through
the earlier sections of the course. Whether that makes the final product
more or less impressive that I didn't need a refresher to achieve... most
of the goal, I don't know.

TLDR: I am stupid and can not comprehend proportions between an IMAGE of a
webpage and the actual webpage.

However, there are some proportional problems that I think are inherent to
my method of reproducing the desired outcome.

This does not look right. Nothing matches up with what I tried to do on
my version of the webpage. I do not know if it is a wide-screen image of the
entire webpage, and everything's only out of proportion because it is essentia-
lly zoomed out, or if it is something else. Regardless, I assumed that this was
simply a single image of the entire webpage. Due to the big black voids on 
both the left and right sides of the image when you open it up in google, I 
first thought that the website was supposed to be really small. Or thin, at 
least. So I tried to squeeze everything into the middle 60% of the webpage.
Later I figured that perhaps something was simply off with the scaling, due 
to the fact I was looking at an IMAGE of a webpage. So, eventually I just
kinda left it and did my best to make it look like the original image,
scaled to the full width of the monitor.

All in all, my main gripe is simply not having a link to the actual website
version of the final product image for proper scaling reference. Although, I
could probably have found a version of it somewhere, I simply am too lazy to 
do that and would rather just suffer through my stupidity of trying to make 
things look as close as possible to the desired outcome.

Oh, also there were some spaces in things that I couldn't really figure out
how to get rid of. Like the hero text and the lil paragraph under it have a
big gap, whereas in the reference image, there is no gap. 



lol imagine using a web-dev practice assignment to lore dump omg lol couldn't
be me---
