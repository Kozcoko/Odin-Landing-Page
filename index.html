                <p>This is a bunch of words underneath the ledger header of your indoctrination. It is said that in the darkest hours of the Lightless Ages, there was not but an eternal cold which gnawed at the bones of all living things. It is thought that this cold was so strong it penetrated through even the earth of the world, such that not even those things of the subterannean world were safe from a frigid death.
