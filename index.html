                <p>It is for our undying faith in the Swords' See that we are granted sights unseen by those of the unbelievers. It is in honor of the Iron Raven that <em>we</em> uphold the integrity of history. Truth unraveled, lies unseen. Whilst our faith in Sverd is eternal, to instill faith, <em>true faith,</em> into one Unseen, is a tremendous task. Fortunately, thou've found yourself in the presence of <em>the</em> High Sword. What I offer thee, Unseen one, is an opportunity. An opportunity to serve the Swords' See with <em>true</em> faith. So I ask, what do <em>you</em> see? Will <em>you</em> see for the Swords' See? <em>Will you be Seen?</em>

                    <li>Yaiasholl, once but a simple Arcanist, became a Runecaster through Sverd's guidance. And now, through his continued loyalty has begun to grasp the intracacies of Seer magic. A path you too, could follow, were thee Seen.</li>

                    <li>Beholden unto the Eye of Myrkul. Once the mortal god of Death, his power has been lost, dispersed across the world by the Divine Rapture. His sole eye is not the only similarity shared between Sverd and Myrkul, for he is only second in power to the High Sword amongst the Swords' Faith, so wholly does he resonate with the teachings of Sverd's devout.</li>

                    <li>My zealous proclamations of eternal faith were not exaggeration. Zyyrtulshrosth was the twelvth Bladetongue ever to serve the Swords' See, so he's quite old. What you see before you now is a manifestation of his pure, absolute devotion unto Sverd. One might even call it a <em>faith elemental.</em></li>
